## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sum, a software engineer passionate about building AI systems that solve real-world problems. What started as curiosity about how machines could "think" during my Computer Science studies at HKU has evolved into a career focused on creating practical AI applications that make people's lives easier.

Currently, I'm fascinated by the intersection of traditional software engineering and AI â€“ building systems that don't just work in research notebooks, but can handle thousands of documents daily, process audio in real-time, and seamlessly integrate into business workflows.

## What I'm Working On

### AI-Powered Chess Engine: ElephantFormer
I recently built an end-to-end transformer-based chess AI for Xiangqi (Chinese Chess) that treats move prediction as a sequence modeling problem. Training on 41,738 professional games, I designed a custom tokenization system and multi-output architecture that achieves strategic pattern learning beyond random play. The project challenged me to think about game AI from a completely different angle â€“ viewing chess moves as language sequences rather than traditional tree search problems.

### Production ML Systems at iSWIM
At iSWIM Technology, I've been architecting end-to-end AI systems that process real business data. My latest project is a report generation system that combines React frontends, ASP.NET backends, and Python FastAPI services with RAG capabilities. The system uses RabbitMQ job queues for async audio transcription with local GPU inference, reducing report creation time by several hours per report.

I also built a data annotation tool that transforms unstructured notes into structured event data â€“ the kind of "invisible AI" that makes workflows smoother without users even realizing there's ML happening behind the scenes.

## My Journey

My path into AI wasn't linear. I started with traditional software development during internships at TRM and Aspex Management, building document management systems and data pipelines. But I kept gravitating toward the challenging problems: How do you extract meaning from messy documents? How do you predict outcomes from incomplete data?

This curiosity led me to dive deep into machine learning during my final year at HKU, where I built a distributed sentiment analysis system under [Prof. Lingpeng Kong's](https://ikekonglp.github.io/) supervision. The project taught me that the real challenge isn't just training models â€“ it's building systems that can process data at scale, serve predictions reliably, and integrate seamlessly with existing workflows.

Since graduating, I've focused on bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical business applications. Whether it's document classification models that process hundreds of pages daily or RAG systems that align with users' writing styles, I'm most excited when AI becomes a natural, helpful part of someone's workflow.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not training models or debugging distributed systems, you'll find me exploring game theory through chess variants, reading about cognitive science, or experimenting with new ML architectures. I'm particularly interested in how different cultures approach strategic thinking â€“ which is partly what inspired the ElephantFormer project.

I'm also passionate about making AI more accessible. Too often, amazing research stays trapped in academic papers. I believe the future belongs to engineers who can take those breakthrough ideas and turn them into systems that actually help people.
