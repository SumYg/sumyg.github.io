<!-- # ElephantFormer: AI-Powered Elephant Chess Engine -->
## Table of contents

## üéØ Project Overview

ElephantFormer is a sophisticated AI system that learns to play [Elephant Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi) using modern Transformer architecture. Unlike traditional chess engines that rely on hand-crafted evaluation functions and minimax algorithms, ElephantFormer learns strategic patterns directly from game data through deep learning.

### Motivation & Prior Work

While powerful traditional engines like [Pikafish](https://github.com/official-pikafish/Pikafish) ‚Äî a state-of-the-art xiangqi engine adapted from [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) that combines alpha-beta search with neural network evaluation ‚Äî dominate competitive play, this project explores an alternative approach: end-to-end learning of chess strategy using pure Transformer architecture. 

By treating chess as a sequence modeling problem, ElephantFormer aims to capture the nuanced patterns of strategic play without explicit game tree search, offering insights into how modern language model architectures can be adapted for complex strategic games.

### Key Innovation
Transforms complex board game moves into a sequence prediction problem, representing each move as a 4-tuple `(from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y)` and training the model to predict the next logical move given game history.

### Technical Approach
Implements a GPT-style transformer with four separate classification heads, each predicting one component of the move coordinates, ensuring legal move generation through game engine integration.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Data Pipeline Flow
```
PGN Files ‚Üí ICCS Parsing ‚Üí Token Sequences ‚Üí Transformer ‚Üí Move Prediction ‚Üí Legal Filtering
```

### Core Components

#### üî§ Tokenization Layer
- **Input Processing:** Converts ICCS move notation into unified token vocabulary
- **Special Tokens:** `<start>`, `<pad>`, `<unk>` for sequence management  
- **Move Encoding:** Each move becomes 4 consecutive tokens representing coordinates

#### üß† Transformer Core
- **Architecture:** Multi-layer transformer encoder with causal masking
- **Embeddings:** Token + positional embeddings for sequence understanding
- **Attention:** Self-attention mechanism learns move patterns and strategies

#### üéØ Output Heads
- **Four Classifiers:** Separate heads for from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y
- **Legal Filtering:** Scores only valid moves from game engine
- **Move Selection:** Highest-scoring legal move becomes the prediction

### Example Tokenization Process
```python
move = "H2-E2"  # ICCS notation
coords = (7, 2, 4, 2)  # Parse to coordinates
tokens = [fx_7, fy_2, tx_4, ty_2]  # Convert to token IDs
sequence = [<start>, fx_7, fy_2, tx_4, ty_2, ...]  # Build sequence
```

## üìä Dataset & Data Pipeline

### Dataset Composition
The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of **41,738 professional Elephant Chess games** sourced from:
- **World Xiangqi Federation games** (41,743 games, ICCS format)
- High-quality tournament and professional play data
- Games parsed from standardized ICCS coordinate notation

### Sequence Length Distribution
The dataset exhibits interesting characteristics when tokenized using the `1 + (num_moves-1)*4` scheme:

| Percentile | Sequence Length | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| 50th (Median) | 305 tokens | Typical game length |
| 90th | 545 tokens | Longer strategic games |
| 99th | 869 tokens | Very long endgames |
| Max | 1,593 tokens | Exceptional marathon games |

**Key Statistics:**
- **Mean length**: 339.25 tokens
- **Range**: 1-1,593 tokens (accommodating everything from quick wins to complex endgames)
- **Training considerations**: Variable-length sequences handled via dynamic batching

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **PGN Parsing**: ICCS coordinate moves converted to (from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y) format
2. **Tokenization**: Each move represented as 4 tokens + START_TOKEN
3. **Quality Filtering**: Games with parsing errors or invalid moves removed
4. **Train/Val Split**: Subset selection for fast prototyping and experimentation

### Why This Dataset Distribution Matters

The long tail of sequence lengths (99.9th percentile at 1,213 tokens) demonstrates the model's ability to handle:
- **Short tactical games**: Quick decisive victories
- **Standard games**: Typical tournament-length matches  
- **Complex endgames**: Extended positional play requiring long-term planning

This distribution directly influenced architectural decisions like context window size and memory-efficient attention mechanisms.

```

### Model Performance Analysis

The model at training epoch 22 (validation loss: 6.36) achieved a **12.49% prediction accuracy** on the test set, correctly predicting 7,027 out of 56,277 moves across 642 games. While this accuracy reflects the challenging nature of exact move prediction in chess, the model demonstrates several key capabilities:

**Win Rate Performance**: In comprehensive gameplay evaluation against random opponents across 1,241 games, the model achieved:
- **Overall Win Rate**: 46.2% (162 wins out of 351 decisive games)
- **Strategic Consistency**: Maintained performance across variable game lengths
- **Decisive Gameplay**: 28.3% decisive game rate with strong win percentage when games reach resolution

**Key Performance Insights**:
- **46.2% win rate** is slightly below random baseline (~50%), indicating room for improvement in overall strategy
- **Significant performance variation** across game length ranges with statistical significance - the key research finding
- **Strategic adaptation**: Performance varies dramatically by game phase, with peak effectiveness in mid-length games (129-192 moves reaching 63.4%)
- **Large-scale validation**: Results based on comprehensive 1,241-game analysis ensuring statistical reliability

While overall performance is slightly below random baseline, the significant variation across game length ranges suggests the model has learned some strategic patterns, particularly excelling in specific game phases.

**Pattern Recognition**: The perplexity score of 683.05 indicates the model has learned meaningful chess patterns, though there's room for optimization in future iterations.

## üî¨ **Research Discovery: Training Sequence Length Effects**

### **Counterintuitive Performance Boundary**
Through comprehensive analysis of **1,241 games** across different game lengths, I discovered a surprising relationship between the model's training sequence length (128 moves = 512 tokens) and its strategic performance:

| Game Length Range | Win Rate | Sample Size | Statistical Significance |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **0-64 moves** | 50.6% | 85 games | Strong early game |
| **65-128 moves** | 25.3% | 99 games | **Training boundary cliff** |
| **129-192 moves** | **63.4%** | 134 games | **Peak performance** |
| **193-256 moves** | 38.5% | 13 games | Gradual decline |
| **257+ moves** | 20.0% | 20 games | Severe degradation |

![Performance by Game Length Range](@/assets/images/performance_by_range.png)

### **Key Research Insights**

üéØ **The Training Boundary Paradox (p < 0.0001):**
- **Performance cliff at training limit**: Win rate drops to 25.3% when approaching the 512-token training boundary
- **Peak performance beyond training**: 63.4% win rate at 129-192 moves - **counterintuitively the model performs best slightly beyond its training sequence length**
- **Complete collapse**: Performance degrades to 20% beyond 257 moves (2√ó training length)

üìä **Statistical Rigor:**
- **65-128 vs 129-192 moves**: p < 0.0001 (***), Odds Ratio = 0.19
- **Early game vs training boundary**: p = 0.0004 (***), Odds Ratio = 3.03  
- **Peak vs far beyond training**: p = 0.0004 (***), Odds Ratio = 6.94

üß† **Strategic Implications:**
1. **Context Window Limitation**: Model struggles when approaching its 512-token training limit
2. **Sweet Spot Discovery**: Games ending at 129-192 moves show optimal strategic resolution
3. **Architectural Insight**: Transformer sequence length limits create unexpected performance boundaries in strategic domains
4. **Training Methodology**: Traditional fixed-length training may not be optimal for strategic games

### **Research Impact**
This discovery demonstrates how transformer architecture constraints manifest in strategic gameplay, with implications for:
- **Chess AI Training**: Models may benefit from varied sequence length training
- **Game AI Deployment**: Consider time controls that favor the model's "sweet spot"
- **Transformer Research**: Evidence of performance boundaries tied to training sequence limits

**Publication Potential**: This counterintuitive finding challenges assumptions about transformer sequence length effects and provides novel insights for the game AI research community.

## What I Learned

This project pushed me to solve several complex problems at the intersection of game AI and modern NLP techniques, ultimately leading to an unexpected research discovery:

1. **Sequence Modeling for Games:** Learning how to represent spatial board game moves as sequences suitable for transformer architecture
2. **Multi-Output Neural Networks:** Designing and training models with multiple classification heads while maintaining consistency
3. **Game Engine Integration:** Ensuring AI-generated moves are always legal through real-time validation
4. **Production ML Pipeline:** Building complete train/evaluate/inference pipeline with proper checkpointing and evaluation
5. **Statistical Analysis & Research:** Conducting rigorous performance analysis that revealed counterintuitive findings about transformer sequence length boundaries

The most challenging aspect was balancing the model's creative freedom with the strict constraints of legal gameplay - a problem that taught me valuable lessons about constrained generation in AI systems.

**Key Research Insight:** Through comprehensive evaluation of 1,241 games, I discovered that the model's performance varies dramatically with game length in unexpected ways - performing worst near its training sequence boundary (65-128 moves: 25.3% win rate) but best just beyond it (129-192 moves: 63.4% win rate). This finding challenged my assumptions about transformer capabilities and taught me that sometimes the most valuable discoveries come from thorough analysis of apparent failures.

**Scientific Methodology:** This project taught me the importance of comprehensive evaluation and statistical rigor in AI research. What began as performance optimization became a research contribution demonstrating how architectural constraints manifest in strategic domains - a reminder that understanding failure modes can be as valuable as achieving high performance.
